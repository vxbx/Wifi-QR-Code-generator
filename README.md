# Wifi-QR-Code-generator
I wanted to make QR-Code to make it easy to connect to the wifi. 
This is completly offline and the only output is the png-file created.

Popup for input of SSID, key and encr. type.
Popup for the output location and the filename of the PNG-file. 
Default QR-Code PNG-name includes the SSID and current date and time.
